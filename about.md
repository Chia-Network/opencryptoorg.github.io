              The Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) is a non-profit community of like-minded people and companies formed to encourage the adoption and
              advancement of cryptocurrency technologies and to remove patents as a barrier to growth and innovation. COPA acknowledges that cryptocurrency 
              technology is built on the collaborative efforts of a community made up of developers, engineers, and designers. The success of cryptocurrency is a 
              direct result of the community coming together to build and develop upon existing technologies for the benefit of all, and we believe COPA will help 
              this happen.

              Crypto organizations have filed for hundreds of patents on cryptocurrency technology and continue to do so in large numbers, causing some concerns:
              1/
              Locking up foundational cryptocurrency technologies in patents stifles innovation and the adoption of these technologies in new and improved
              applications.

              While patents are useful defensively and can serve as a lawsuit deterrent, misguided and offensive use of patents by bad actors threatens the growth  
              and free availability of cryptocurrency technologies. Many crypto companies do not own patents and are unable to adequately deter or defend against 
              these bad actors.

             COPA provides an open patent strategy to address these concerns. Anyone can join and benefit from COPA, regardless of whether they have patents or not.
             There is no barrier to entry â€“ members can be individuals, start-ups, small companies, or large corporations. This is how COPA works:

             First, COPA members pledge never to use their crypto-technology patents against anyone, except for defensive reasons, effectively making their patents
             freely available for all to use.
