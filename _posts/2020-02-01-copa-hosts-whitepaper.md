title: COPA Hosts the Bitcoin Whitepaper
---
COPA operates on the principle that open access to patents covering foundational cryptocurrency technologies is necessary for the community to grow, freely innovate, and build new and better products.

The Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) stands for an open financial system and was formed to remove barriers that would stifle innovation and deter mass-adoption. As such, we stand in solidarity with the crypto community by hosting the Bitcoin Whitepaper on our website.

COPA believes that we have the legal right to host this original bitcoin whitepaper and that any claims purporting to constrain its free availability are baseless.

For more information on COPA or to join our membership, email membership@open-patent.org.
