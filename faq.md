  - title: What is COPA?
    content: >
        COPA is a non-profit community of people and companies formed to encourage the adoption and advancement of 
        crypto technologies and to remove patents as a barrier to growth and innovation. The success of 
        cryptocurrency depends on the community coming together to build and develop upon existing technologies to 
        innovate, which is not possible when parties tie up the technologies in patents and litigation. 
        Accordingly, COPA members take on a pledge to never assert their patents on foundational cryptocurrency 
        technology against anyone, except for defensive reasons, and also agree to pool their patents together in 
        a shared patent library such that any member has access to use another member’s patent defensively if they 
        are forced into patent litigation by an aggressor.

        <B>The need:</B> While patents may at times be useful for defensive purposes, 
        offensive and misguided use of patents threatens the growth and adoption of emerging technologies, 
        such as cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency adoption is still relatively at a nascent stage and we do not 
        want patents locking up foundational technology and stifling growth and adoption.   

        <BR/><BR/>We want to eliminate barriers to innovation, rather than letting patents become one. Further, 
        there is a need for leveling of the playing field – while there are a few companies that hold a large 
        number of patents in the space, even if only for defensive reasons (i.e., to counter against a patent 
        aggressor by asserting their patents defensively), a large number of smaller companies and startups do not 
        have access to patents to defend themselves should they be sued by these aggressors. We need a solution 
        that both removes patents as a blocker to growth and also empowers the entire community to be able to 
        defend against patent aggressors.  

        <BR/><BR/><B>How do we address the needs:</B>  COPA addresses these concerns through a 
        two-prong approach. First, by making COPA members pledge that they will never assert their patents on   
        foundational cryptocurrency technology against anyone except for defensive purposes, COPA effectively 
        makes such technology freely available for all to use and drives down the incidence and threat of patent 
        litigation in the process. Second, by creating a shared patent library that allows members to use each 
        others’ patents as needed defensively against patent aggressors, COPA empowers everyone in the community 
        with tools and leverage to defend themselves. The shared patent library operates as a shield, which gets 
        larger and stronger with more members joining, for every member – regardless of whether they are small or 
        large, whether they own patents themselves or not – ultimately benefiting the entire community.  

        <BR/><BR/>COPA seeks to transform how patents are viewed and used – from potentially disruptive weapons to 
        tools that aid in breaking barriers to the innovation and advancement of cryptocurrency technology.

          How does COPA benefit individuals and small companies vs. larger companies?
          There is no barrier to entry – any individual, small company, or large corporation can enroll as members. 
          Every member benefits from the patent pledge – by removing patents as an offensive threat, and consequently 
          removing the stigma around patents, crypto companies can now put patents to work to protect the community – 
          to defend against patent aggressors and protect their technology from patent trolls.
          
          <br/><br/>The shared patent library democratizes patents for everyone in the COPA membership by offering a 
          collective shield of patents. Individuals and small companies, that often lack access to patents to use defensively 
          when needed against aggressors, benefit from having access to a potentially large and strong set of COPA’s 
          collective patents to potentially use. Even outside of actually using the patents defensively, every member, 
          small or large in size, benefits from the mere fact of having access to the collective shield of patents. 
          Driving down the incidence of and deterring offensive patent litigation are fundamental objectives of COPA, 
          and the shared patent library helps do exactly that – in helping deter patent aggressors from suing the members, 
          regardless of whether they individually own patents or not, because of their ability to access patents from this collective shield.
